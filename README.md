# star-wars-parallax
In preparation for the upcoming "Star Wars: Rogue One" the Solodev team decided to write a Star Wars themed post on adding parallax with multiple backgrounds to your website using jQuery ScollTo by Ariel Flesler. Instead of your run of the mill stock photos, our example is filled with Tie Fighters, X-Wings, ATT Walkers, and the Death Star as backgrounds.
